	"desc": "<p>I was born in October 1983. After getting my Degree in Mass Communication and Journalism in 2006, I persuaded my higher study in Animation and Multimedia from CDAC. I got my first job as Graphic Designer in the year 2007. After getting experience in graphic designing for an year, I moved to Website and Mobile UI-UX Designing. I started from designing graphics for advertisements, landing pages and email newsletters and gradually worked on designing websites and iPhone applications. From those days of hard work, almost 18 hours of labor and dreams of how to be the one, I had been pushing myself till date. Now its been almost 8 years of total experience in designing visual UI for mobile and web applications.</p><p>In 2012, I decided to work alone and started working as a Freelance Web, UI-UX and Mobile Interface Designer. I learnt and achieved new skills like User Interface Designing, Content Strategy, Information Architecture, Typography, and tools like Adobe After Effect, Cinema 4D, xHTML, WordPress and many other things. I find myself still in learning phase and desire to achieve as much skills as I can.</p><blockquote><p>A great design comes with a responsibility. A design that is intelligent and the way it can benefit the end user should be always the primary goal. Good design helps like a friend, bad ones just leaves you in middle.</p></blockquote>",
